# dbt-airflow
A Python package that helps Data and Analytics engineers render dbt projects on Apache Airflow
in a way that every single dbt resource (model, test, seed and snapshot) is represented by a single
Airflow task. 

### Features
- Render dbt project as a TaskGroup in Airflow Tasks
- Every `model`, `seed` and `snapshot` resource that has at least a single test, will also have a corresponding
test task as a downstream.
- Add extra tasks before or after the whole dbt project
- Add extra tasks after specific dbt tasks

## How does it work
The library essentially builds on top of the metadata generated by `dbt-core` and are stored in 
the `target/manifest.json` file in your dbt project directory.  

## Domain Requirements

- Every dbt project, when compiled, will generate a metadata file under `<dbt-project-dir>/target/manifest.json`
- The manifest file contains information about the interdependencies of the project's data models
- `dbt-airflow` aims to extract these dependencies such that every dbt entity (snapshot, model, test and seed) has 
  its own task in a Airflow DAG while entity dependencies are persisted
- Snapshots are never an upstream dependency of any task
- The creation of snpashots on seeds does not make sense, and thus not handled 
  not even sure if this is even possible on dbt side)
- Models may have tests
- Snapshots may have tests
- Seeds may have tests

# Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed through `pip`:
```bash
pip install dbt-airflow
```

`dbt` needs to connect to your target environment (database, warehouse etc.) and in order to do so, it makes use of 
different adapters, each dedicated to a different technology (such as Postgres or BigQuery). Therefore, before running
`dbt-airflow` you also need to ensure that the required adapter(s) are installed in your environment. 

For the full list of available adapters please refer to the official 
[dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters).

# Usage
`dbt-airflow` can be used either as a normal Python package, or through the 
command line interface. 

Given that there are possibly many different ways for deploying Airflow and automating different aspects
of data workflows that involve Airflow, dbt and potentially other tools as well, we wanted to offer more
flexibility by providing different approaches for using `dbt-airflow`.

### Building an Airflow DAG using `dbt-airflow`

```python3
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

from airflow import DAG

from dbt_airflow.task_group import build_dag

with DAG(
        dag_id='test_dag',
        start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),
        catchup=False,
        tags=['example'],
) as dag:
  build_dag(
    dbt_manifest_path=Path('path/to/dbt/project/target/manifest.json'),
    dbt_target='dev',
    dbt_project_path=Path('path/to/dbt/project'),
    dbt_profile_path=Path('path/to/dbt/profiles'),
  )
```

If you would like to contribute to `dbt-airflow` project, you will essentially need to follow the steps outlined below:
1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Set up the development environment on your local machine (see the detailed guide below)
3. Write and test your contribution
4. Create a Pull Request

##  Setting up your local development environment

TO BE FINALISED
```bash
docker-compose build

docker-compose up

# Access postgres db (changed to port 5433 given that we have an additional postgres instance for Airflow itsefl)
docker ps  # get the container id of postgres-sakila
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
psql -U postgres -p 5433 
```

```bash
# Install poetry
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies in poetry venv
poetry install 

# Run tests
poetry run tests -rP -vv

# Run specific test(s)
poetry run tests -k "test_name_or_prefix" -rP -vv
```
